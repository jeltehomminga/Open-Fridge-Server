Open Fridge makes it possible for people that have food to offer and that are in need of food to connect in a social friendly way.

When a user has food to offer then the offer can be placed in the app, or the food can be offered as a response to a foodrequest. There are various reasons why the food can be offered. For example because the user will go on holiday. Or on the countryside it can happen that a farmer has over production. Whatever the reason is it would be a waste to throw the food away. When offering the food the expirydate is mandatory to prevent that expired food will be offered.

If the user is a foodconsumer then a request can be made for food or the food consumer can respond on foodoffers. If the user responds on a foodoffer, the user can come into contact with the person that offers the food.
